I am **Tianci Zhang (张天慈)**, currently working at Nanjing Forestry University. Before joining NJFU, I studied at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Queen Mary University of London, and obtained a PhD degree from NUAA in 2018. My research interest mainly lies in data-driven optimisation and intelligent vehicles.
