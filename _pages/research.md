## 1. Interpretable adversarial attacks with causal disentangled representations

*Summer Research Program at HKUST*

In this research, we explore the relationship between causal disentanglement and adversarial attack. We propose a prospective method to detect adversarial examples by causal disentanglement and provide a direct interpretation for the adversarial noise from causal perspectives.
